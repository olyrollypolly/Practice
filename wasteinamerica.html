    <center><h1>Waste in America</h1></center>

    <p>If youâ€™re an average American, you produce 4.4. pounds of trash every single day, significantly more than the global average of 2.6 pounds. In a nation of nearly 324 million people, that amounts to more than 700,000 tons of garbage produced daily, enough to fill around 60,000 garbage trucks. This means that Americans alone are creating too much trash. Our whole ecomomy is build on making trash, but what are we supposed to do.</p>
    <p2>While the amount of garbage Americans produce is high, there are big differences when you look at the numbers for each state. The three states that produced the fewest tons of garbage per person are Idaho (4.1), North Dakota (5.2) and Connecticut (7.3). Those states stand in stark contrast to the three states that produced the most tons per capita: Colorado (35.2), Pennsylvania (35.4) and Nevada (38.4).</p2>
    <p3>The threat of waste to the environment, health and safety is huge. And so are the financial and social ramifications, waste experts say.
Pollution runs into rivers and seeps into ground water. Flooding is caused by garbage clogging drains, and the atmosphere can be poisoned by the toxic discharge from trash.
When waste is not collected, the frequency of illness such as diarrhea doubles and acute respiratory infection.</p3>
    <p4>From 2007, Eagle county has seen a 30 percent drop in total tons of new material at its landfill. This means that people are throwing way less products with packaging, which means they are buying less of these products. The picture above is of the Eagle County Landfill in Wollcot, CO </p4>
