    <p>When Ireland enacted a 15 cent per bag charge, consumers consumed 90 percent fewer bags. About one year ago Vail, CO got rid of plastic bags completley, charge if you need to use paper bags. This made people use re-usable bags to take their groceries home.</p>
    <p2>The EPA estimates that Americans generated about 254 million tons of garbage in 2013. That is a shocking amount of waste. Among developed nations, only New Zealand, Ireland, Norway and Switzerland produce more municipal solid waste per capita.</p2>
    <p3>This year, the world will generate 2.6 trillion pounds of garbage -- the weight of about 7,000 Empire State Buildings. In both rich and poor countries, the vast majority of our waste goes into landfills where it's (often) covered up. A very small share of waste in the World Bank's data -- which, the authors admit, was difficult to collect for this category -- went to recycled or composted waste. "Africa's collected waste is almost exclusively dumped or sent to landfills," the report said.</p3>
